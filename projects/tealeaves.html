      Tea Leaves is a website that I started working on with my friend
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgreuel">Dan</a>
      a few months ago. It invites users to make predictions on world events.
      We have lots of ideas about how the app might be refined and expanded
      which will be implemented over time.
    </h4>
    <h4>It's still pre-beta.</h4>

      The idea first came to me five or six years ago while I was in law
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back then, I was reading dozens of newspapers and magazines
      on international affairs from cover to cover. While reading,
      I often thought that it would be more fun if I could quickly make
      predictions on the issues I was reading about. At that time, I hadn't
      thought deeply about becoming a programmer myself, so it was just a passing
      thought. I was mostly surprised that someone else hadn't created the
      app already.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year or two ago, after I decided that I was going to become a programmer,
      this seemed like a good first app.

      Since Dan and I started working on this, a few comparable applications have
      emerged, but still none of them have moved into the niche that we hope to fill.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.predictit.org/">Predict It</a>, for example,
      allows users to make predictions on political events, but they are focused on
      users betting money on outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://called.it/">Called It</a>
      and <a href="https://areyousage.com/">Sage</a> encourage preditions without
      getting money involved, but they encourage predictions on anything.
      This not only leads to predictions on sports and celebrities, which Dan and
      I are not interested in, but they also lead to users submitting ridiculous predictions
      just to be funny. Like one Called It user predicted "YOLO will be the
      leading cause of death in 2016." While I wholeheartedly agree with the prediction,
      Dan and I don't care to create a forum for that kind of thing.
      There's already plenty of space for jokes like that on Twitter and other social networks.

      When I looked at other people's personal sites, I liked how they incorporated
      prominent but faded pictures in the front of their site, so that's where I started.
      Plus, I'm a nerd for books, so I always like including books or libraries
      wherever I can.
    </p>
    <p class="project-text">
      I liked it, but I wanted to try a few other examples before committing to one.
    </p>

      But, I also wanted to experiment a bit with something simpler and sleeker.
      I am always most impressed by the simplest design styles. And I had fun
      experimenting with creating the floating shapes in the front of the screen
      and making them look good on different screen sizes.

      Yet, this design needed a bit more color and personality, which led me to
      the current incarnation. Send me a message with one of the social links below
      and let me know what you think.
