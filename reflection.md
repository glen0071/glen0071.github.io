What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

The most confusing obstacle I encountered so far was with collapsing margins, how it can differ between browsers, and how it can lead to a fixed footer covering up some of your main content. I was able to fix the issue in Chrome but I haven't yet figured out how to fix it in Safari, and I was losing a lot of time trying to figure it out. This is something I will have to come back to.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I have been trying to find the best way to position elements in a way that maintains consistency of style with different screen sizes. I haven't figured it all out yet, but i discovered that setting positioning values as percentages rather than fixed numbers seems to help a lot. I still need to make more edits for it to even work on mobile screens, but I think that is a bigger problem that repositioning cannot fix by itself.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest thing to implement was creating the header, footer, and other broad aspects of a basic template. I guess I have done enough of those to remember how to finish it pretty quickly. The most difficult part was to maintain the right spacing and positing of elements within the main content sections.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

The more I work on CSS, the more I learn it, and the more I am able to quickly translate my thoughts onto the webpage. Also, it means I spend less time on boring aspects of trying to get a footer to sit flush against the edge of the window, and I can spend more time thinking about the overall style and theme. All of that makes it more fun.

I ended up redesigning the site more than once, and breaking far away from my original wire frame. The wireframing process was still helpful in the beginning, but as I am trying to make the site something I can share widely and be proud of, it seemed necessary to redesign it a few times.
