    <h3>What are the benefits of version control? How does git help you keep track of changes? Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
    <p>
      Oh crap, I was trying to add some changes that were suggested by my coworkers
      in Bangladesh, Brazil, and Turkey. But, now I can't find the documents that
      they sent me. They are gone forever!

    <p>
      You should really use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version Control System</a> for projects like this.
      The most popular exmample of it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>. We use it all the time in software
      development. It's a life saver! You first have to memorize a few odd phrases in
      order to use it in your computer's command line, but once you get the hang of
      it, you'll want to use it everywhere!
    </p>
    <p>
      I use it all the time cooking!  I start the recipe on what I call the
      [master branch].
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when I want to experiment with some new flavors, I can make
      additional branches to toy with by pressing [git checkout -b new-branch-name]
    </p>

    <p>
      In the pic, you can see that I created a directory called cookieFest, and
      then entered [git branch] into my command line to display a list of all
      the branches I made, experimenting with different flavors.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the master branch won't be affected by any of these branches until
      I decide to merge them together. When I want to save my progress along the
      way, I press [git add .] and then [git commit -m
      'message']. in the 'message', I include whatever is I did in that step,
      ususally with something like, 'add beets' or 'fry spaghetti'
      kind of like I'm writing a recipe along the way, and it creates a record
      of every step I made, and exactly what the recipe tasted like at that time.

      Then, later on, I can 'checkout' those earlier 'commits', and git will
      show me exactly what the recipe was like at that time. I sometimes use that
      to see if I liked the taste better before some changes were added.

      Also, if I want to mix my branch with the master branch (which git users
      call 'mergin'), I press [git checkout master] and then [git merge origin
      branch-name]. Then all the changes in my branch are added into the master
      branch, and git will warn me if there are 'conflicts' along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, when I finish the recipe, I  just press [git branch -d
      branch-name] with every branch that I no longer need, and it's out of the
      way forever! My guests won't have to eat a bunch of spinach cookies leftover
      from my experiments. I don't even have to do the dishes for all those
      extra branches!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cool perk is that I can post my recipe on Github.com for other
      chefs to look at and experiment with. If they see something that they
      want to experiment with, they can 'clone' my recipe (although, recipes
      posted there are technically called 'repositories'). That'll create a copy
      of my recipe for them to play with. I don't have to do any work to share
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, they will want to share their experiment with me, so they will
      send me a 'pull request'. If I like their changes I can 'merge' them into
      my recipe, and all their delicious ideas are included in my recipe too!
