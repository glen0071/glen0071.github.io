    <h3>What are the benefits of version control? How does git help you keep track of changes? Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>

    <p>
      Version control maintains a record of changes within a codebase by taking snapshots of every "commit."
      The most common example of these version control tools is Git. Git was first developed in 2005 by Linus
      Torvalds to ease collaboration around development of the Linux Kernel. Much like everything else Mr.
      Torvalds is involved with, Git is now available to all to use as a free software.
    </p>

    <p>
      GitHub is a website that offers many tools that enable users to take advantage of Git's most valuable
      features while the repository is hosted online - which makes collaboration with other users even easier.
    </p>

    <p>This is what baking cookies might look like if we could use Git version control...</p>

        <td>
          I am starting a new recipe and I'll likely make some mistakes along the way.
          I would also like to experiment a bit along the way without ruining the whole batch.

          Creates a “repository” of the recipe or project.
          Every time I “commit changes”, a snapshot of the project’s current state will be saved.

          Git add .
        </td>
        <td>
          Git add . places all the ingredients on a table so I can take
          a snapshot of their current state. In Git, this is called
          placing the changes in a “staging area”.

          Git commit –m ‘whisk flour, baking soda, and salt’
        </td>
        <td>
          “Git commit” takes a
          snapshot, so I can return to this spot anytime in the future.
          The ‘-m whisk flour, baking soda, and salt’ adds a message or
          summary for that snapshot.
          <!-- add jQuery note: The awkward grammar (using “whisk”
          instead of “whisked”) is intentional. It is supposed to capture
          what is accomplished when you “commit” those changes.  -->
