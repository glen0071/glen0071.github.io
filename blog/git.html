    <h3>What are the benefits of version control? How does git help you keep track of changes? Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>

    <p>
      Version control maintains a record of changes within a codebase by taking snapshots of every "commit."
      The most common example of these version control tools is Git. Git was first developed in 2005 by Linus
      Torvalds to ease collaboration around development of the Linux Kernel. Much like everything else Mr.
      Torvalds is involved with, Git is now available to all to use as a free software.
    </p>

    <p>
      GitHub is a website that offers many tools that enable users to take advantage of Git's most valuable
      features while the repository is hosted online - which makes collaboration with other users even easier.
    </p>

    <h3>A Git Tutorial - As applied to baking:</h3>

    <p>This is what baking cookies might look like if we could use Git version control...</p>

        <td>
          I am starting a new recipe and I'll likely make some mistakes along the way.
          I would also like to experiment a bit along the way without ruining the whole batch.

          a snapshot of their current state. In Git, this is called
          placing the changes in a “staging area”.

          summary for that snapshot.

        <td>
          The git add . and git commit –m work the same as in earlier steps.
          You just need to do that before you switch branches to make sure that
          the changes are saved to that specific branch.

          Git checkout moves me back to the master branch, and git merch
          chocolate-chip-walnut incorporates all of the changes in that branch
          into the current branch.
