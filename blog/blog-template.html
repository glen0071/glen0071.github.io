How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

- It was nice creating a wireframe with a pair. After doing the first pairing session and the GPS, this challenge was much shorter and simply than the others. Pairing is more valuable on more challenging lessons.

It was valuable to have a pair there to talk through the purpose behind some of the design decisions that we were making.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

- I find wireframing more valuable in a more complex website. The Template was so simple that I'm not sure if taking an extra step to wireframe was helpful in improving the page itself.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We didn't spend a lot of time on this specific question, but I guess the implication of our work and process was that we started by adding the most common and necessary elements of an HTML page (like head, title, header, footer, etc.). Then, we added more and more elements until all of the "universal" elements were included.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

My pair pointed out how the article tag could be used. I wasn't familiar with that one.
