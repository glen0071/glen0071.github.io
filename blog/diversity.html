    <section><h3>People are aware of this problem</h3>
      <p>
        As an African American, I have a personal interest in seeing more people of color in the tech industry. It is fairly well known that people of color are sparse among developers. I could link some articles drawing attention to this issue, but it seems that has been done before. Similarly, others have tried to diagnose this issue trying to identify its underlying cause and the most efficient solution. I don't have the knowledge or experience to contribute that debate except to reflect on my own experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in middle school I had strong natural interest and ability in math and science. But, I never had friends or a community of people to explore it with. All the kids my age just wanted to play sports, so I hid my nerdy interest in engineering and tried to fit in. When I was young, there were not any places for young people to develop an interest of this kind, to have fun with it, and to be around peers who enjoyed exploring engineering. There was my first missed opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I reached high school, I started getting a little more serious about my studies and career, which continued into college. At that time, I was chiefly interested in fighting racism and other forms of prejudice, and engaging social justice and law seemed like the obvious place to carry out those aspirations. I sometimes remembered the interest in quantitative sciences from my youth, but I did not see how that work contributed to the social good like law and policy. This was a second missed opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that history in mind, I would have needed further encouragement to channel that desire in the right direction. Fortunately, numerous initiatives have begun to better channel those desires in others. The few  obstacles that I encountered, a lack of community to enjoy technology with and a failure to see it as a contribution to the public good, have been addressed by various other organizations.

    <section><h3>How I can help</h3>
      <p>
        I have worked closely with kids for years in neighborhood level community building activities intended to build community and encourage a spirit of service among young people. While I have been in the midst of this career
        transition, I haven't been able to keep up with those efforts, and I miss it dearly. I have always planned on diving back into it. It is only natural that I weave this interest and experience with my growing career as a developer.

      <p>
        I am especially eager to support projects like  <a target="_blank" href="https://coderdojo.com/">Coder Dojo</a>. I don't know a lot about this organization, but it seems to offer a space for young people to nurture their natural interest in science and technology, and to have fun! I would have loved something like that as a kid. Contacting Coder Dojo and other organizations like that is one of my top priorities after I have completed Dev Bootcamp, and to take up similar efforts in high schools and with whatever other young people want to learn along with me.
