      <h3>Securing the Internet of Things</h3>
      <p>
        Before I started programming, I went to law school and worked at a non-profit
        for a few years. I enjoyed that work quite a bit, and I still find many legal
        issues interesting. But, I'm such a nerd, that after studying law all day
        I would go home and study programming all night, and I gradually fell in love
        with it. I am never sure if and how my legal training will now play a role in
        my career. I am frequently reminded that one potential intersection of my
        previous work and my growing technology interests would be in the  security
        issues that arise with new technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know enough about the Internet of Things to make predictions about
        how fast it will occur. But, I like to keep an eye
        on it, to see how it evolves. The phrase
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">"Internet of Things"</a>
        has been
        attached to various efforts to connect physical devices and household
        products to the Internet. For example, your flowerpot could text you
        when they need to be watered. Or, your fridge could maintain an index of how much
        food you have left and email you to warn if you are running low on milk
        or eggs, or automatically order more to be delivered to your house.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to these minor conveniences, more dramatic links could be made
        to order a refill of your medicine, or to warn your doctor if you miss a dose.
        There is vast potential for gathering data on customer needs and habits,
        and new industries are growing
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2015/04/22/117-billion-market-for-internet-of-things-in-healthcare-by-2020/">fast</a>.
        And this stuff isn't all coming in the future. Some is already here.
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teslamotors.com/support/software-updates">Tesla</a>,
        for example, already updates its cars while the customers' cars sit parked
        in the garage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from all of this exciting potential, some serious security concerns
        may arise. Floating more data between our devices may create more opportunities
        to steal it, hack it, and manipulate it. In one dramatic example,
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/">
        Wired magazine shared</a> how some good-intentioned hackers hacked
        a jeep, and killed the engine, while it was traveleing down the highway.
        Such a dramatic scene is still only a hint of what bad-intentioned hackers
        might do. I want to keep eye on this stuff as the field grows.
